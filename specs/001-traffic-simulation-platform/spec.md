# Traffic Simulation and Analysis Platform - Feature Specification

## Overview
A platform for simulating realistic web traffic using automated agents and comparing the behavioral patterns with real human navigation to identify discriminant signals for bot detection and generate traffic.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Traffic Simulation Engine**
   - Generate automated web sessions via headless browsers
   - Support multiple user personas (Rapid Visitor, Average Visitor, Explorer)
   - Simulate realistic human behaviors: clicks, scrolling, text input, navigation
   - Configurable session parameters: duration, page depth, temporal variations

2. **Data Collection System**
   - Capture comprehensive session metrics: timestamps, pages visited, action sequences
   - Record behavioral data: click patterns, scroll behaviors, dwell times
   - Store aggregated analytics: session duration distributions, CTR, navigation paths

3. **Analysis & Comparison Engine**
   - Compare simulated vs. real human traffic patterns
   - Identify discriminant signals for bot detection
   - Generate visual reports: graphs, heatmaps, behavioral analysis
   - Export analysis results and datasets

4. **Management Dashboard**
   - Configure simulation campaigns
   - Monitor real-time simulation progress
   - View historical analysis results
   - Manage user personas and scenarios

### User Stories

#### Administrator/Researcher
- As an admin, I want to configure simulation parameters so I can test different bot detection scenarios
- As a researcher, I want to compare simulated vs. human traffic to identify unique behavioral signatures
- As an admin, I want to export collected data for further analysis in external tools

#### System
- As a system, I need to orchestrate multiple simulation agents to generate concurrent sessions
- As a system, I need to store session data in a structured format for analysis

### Technical Requirements

#### Performance
- Support 1000+ concurrent simulated sessions
- Response time <200ms for dashboard operations
- Handle datasets with 1M+ session records
- 99.9% uptime for continuous monitoring

#### Scalability

- Cloud-native architecture (containerized)
- Efficient data storage and retrieval

## Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Successfully simulate 3 distinct user personas with realistic behavioral variations
2. **Accuracy**: Identify at least 5 discriminant signals between simulated and human traffic
3. **Performance**: Generate 10,000 sessions within 1 hour with full data capture
4. **Usability**: Non-technical users can configure and run basic simulations via dashboard
5. **Analysis**: Produce comprehensive reports comparing behavioral patterns
