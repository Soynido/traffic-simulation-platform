# Research: Traffic Simulation and Analysis Platform

## Technology Decisions

### Browser Automation: Playwright
**Decision**: Use Playwright for headless browser automation  
**Rationale**: 
- Supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Excellent performance with concurrent sessions
- Rich API for simulating human behaviors (clicks, scrolling, typing)
- Built-in network interception and timing controls
- Active development by Microsoft with strong community

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Selenium: Slower, more resource intensive, less reliable for concurrent sessions
- Puppeteer: Chrome-only, less cross-browser testing capability
- Firecrawl: Good for scraping but less suited for behavioral simulation

### Backend Framework: FastAPI
**Decision**: FastAPI for backend API and simulation orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- High performance async framework ideal for concurrent simulations
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Built-in validation with Pydantic models
- WebSocket support for real-time dashboard updates
- Excellent typing support for maintainability

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flask: Less performant for concurrent operations, less modern
- Django: Too heavy for API-first architecture, slower async support
- Express.js: Would require separate Python service for Playwright

### Frontend: Next.js + React
**Decision**: Next.js with React for dashboard interface  
**Rationale**:
- Server-side rendering for better performance
- API routes for backend integration
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Rich ecosystem for data visualization (recharts, d3)
- Vercel deployment optimization

**Alternatives considered**:
- Create React App: Less optimized, no SSR
- Vue.js: Smaller ecosystem for data visualization
- Svelte: Less mature ecosystem, fewer visualization libraries

### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma
**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
**Rationale**:
- JSON column support for flexible session data storage
- Excellent performance for time-series analytics data
- ACID compliance for consistent data
- Prisma provides type-safe database access with migrations
- Strong support for complex queries and aggregations

**Alternatives considered**:
- MongoDB: Less structured, weaker consistency guarantees
- ClickHouse: Excellent for analytics but complex setup
- SQLite: Not suitable for concurrent write operations

### Task Queue: BullMQ + Redis
**Decision**: BullMQ with Redis for job orchestration  
**Rationale**:
- Handles thousands of concurrent simulation jobs
- Built-in retry mechanisms and error handling
- Real-time progress tracking for dashboard
- Redis provides fast caching for frequently accessed data
- Horizontal scaling support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Celery: Python-only, more complex setup
- Simple threading: No persistence, no scaling
- AWS SQS: Vendor lock-in, less real-time capabilities

### Deployment: Docker + Container Orchestration
**Decision**: Containerized deployment with Docker  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent environments across development and production
- Isolated browser processes for security
- Easy horizontal scaling of simulation workers
- Resource management and limits
- Cloud-agnostic deployment

**Alternatives considered**:
- Bare metal deployment: Complex setup, harder scaling
- Serverless: Not suitable for long-running browser sessions
- VM-based: Higher resource overhead

## Architecture Patterns

### Simulation Engine Design
**Decision**: Actor model with worker processes  
**Rationale**:
- Each simulation session runs in isolated process
- Fault tolerance - failed sessions don't affect others
- Resource management - memory/CPU limits per worker
- Horizontal scaling by adding worker nodes

### Data Collection Strategy
**Decision**: Event-driven data streaming  
**Rationale**:
- Real-time data collection during simulation
- Efficient batch writes to database
- Flexible schema for different event types
- Easy to add new metrics without schema changes

### Analytics Processing
**Decision**: Batch processing with incremental updates  
**Rationale**:
- Heavy analytics computations run offline
- Dashboard shows cached results for performance
- Incremental updates for real-time metrics
- Separates OLTP (sessions) from OLAP (analytics)

## Security & Ethics Considerations

### Rate Limiting Strategy
**Decision**: Adaptive rate limiting per target site  
**Rationale**:
- Respects target site resources
- Configurable limits based on site capacity
- Automatic backoff on errors
- Compliance with robots.txt

### Data Privacy
**Decision**: Anonymized data collection only  
**Rationale**:
- No personal information stored
- Session IDs are generated, not derived from users
- GDPR compliance for European deployment
- Clear data retention policies

### Defensive Security Focus
**Decision**: Simulation for defense only, not attack  
**Rationale**:
- Educational and research purposes only
- Built-in safeguards against misuse
- Ethical guidelines in documentation
- No support for malicious traffic generation

## Performance Optimization

### Concurrent Session Handling
**Decision**: Process-based concurrency with resource limits  
**Rationale**:
- Browser processes are inherently resource-heavy
- Process isolation prevents memory leaks
- Configurable limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Better error recovery than thread-based approach

### Data Storage Optimization
**Decision**: Hybrid storage strategy  
**Rationale**:
- Hot data (recent sessions) in PostgreSQL
- Cold data (historical analytics) in compressed storage
- Time-series partitioning for query performance
- Automated data lifecycle management

### Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-layer caching with Redis  
**Rationale**:
- Session metadata cached for quick dashboard updates
- Analytics results cached for performance
- Configuration data cached to reduce database load
- Cache invalidation on data updates

## Development & Testing Strategy

### Test-Driven Development
**Decision**: TDD with real dependencies in integration tests  
**Rationale**:
- Complex system requires integration testing
- Real browser testing for accurate behavior simulation
- Database integration tests with actual PostgreSQL
- No mocking for core business logic

### Local Development Environment
**Decision**: Docker Compose for complete local stack  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent environment across team
- Easy setup for new developers
- Includes all dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Hot reloading for development efficiency

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Decision**: GitHub Actions with containerized testing  
**Rationale**:
- Automated testing on every commit
- Browser testing in headless containers
- Performance regression testing
- Automated deployment to staging/production
